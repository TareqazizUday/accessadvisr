                                By donating to AccessAdvisr, you help make accessibility information more comprehensive and useful for everyone. We plan to expand our features to include support for a wider range of disabilities, increasing the number of reviews and reaching a larger audience of disabled users. Your contribution will also make it easier for users to add reviews, track their review history, and enjoy other improvements that enhance the overall user experience. Every donation helps create a more inclusive platform where accessibility insights are accessible to all.
